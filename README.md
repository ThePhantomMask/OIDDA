# OIDDA for the Flax Engine
OIDDA (Organic Intelligent Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment) is an intelligent difficulty adaptation system designed to create personalised and seamless gaming experiences. Unlike traditional static difficulty systems, OIDDA constantly monitors player behaviour and adapts the game in real time, without requiring manual intervention or difficulty selection menus.

## **The system uses statistical analysis and behavioural assessment algorithms to understand**:
* The player's playing style
* Strengths and weaknesses
* Performance in different situations
* Progression patterns
